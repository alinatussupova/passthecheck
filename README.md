# Password Manager





In our digital world we have a lot of data that have to be secured. Therefore we must provide defense against unwanted access to our information, to our data. Using password is one of the most popular security tool that we use on daily basis for so many purposes. But we also know that a loads of passwords have been hacked, especially if yours is a weak one or easy to hack or too “popular”. So what we should do? How to know that this particular password is strong one and safeguarding to defence our data? Of course, there are loads of tools, that check our passwords, but how trustworthy they are? We can type our personal information in some source and our data can be intercepted, because oftentimes our data will be saved in that source. So how you can see, it’s not safe to use those tools for checking our personal data. 

That’s why I developed a program that can check a password, using only our computers. This program shows how many times your password has been hacked. Or when we come up with some watchwords, we can check them, and so can choose the most secure one.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

**About the program**: Password Manager can help you to determine how many times a certain password has been hacked. So you can select the most secure one.

**The challenge:** people who’s dealt with’s got hacked by their passwords.

**The goal:** Create a program that can be helpful for people to provide more security for their information.


That's how you can check the password:
